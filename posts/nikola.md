Hello, Nikola!
--------------

So after much deliberation I've switched my blog from [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com) to [Nikola](https://github.com/ralsina/nikola), a static blog generator. Using Nikola, I can now keep all of my blog articles under source control, and in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)!

I'm currently just getting started with Nikola, but I will have most of my old posts imported soon, and I will have a full write up of my experience using Nikola in the next few days.

I am also switching the discussions over to Discus, which will be a very nice addition.

Sorry for the long absence, I hope you haven't written me off.
