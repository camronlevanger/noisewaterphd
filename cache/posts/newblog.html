<h3>Hello, Nikola!</h3>
<p>So after much deliberation I've switched my blog from <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ralsina/nikola">Nikola</a>, a static blog generator. Using Nikola, I can now keep all of my blog articles under source control, and in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>!</p>
<p>I'm currently just getting started with Nikola, but I will have most of my old posts imported soon, and I will have a full write up of my experience using Nikola in the next few days.</p>
<p>I am also switching the discussions over to Discus, which will be a very nice addition.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long absence, I hope you haven't written me off.</p>
